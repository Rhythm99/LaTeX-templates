%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Instruction for Ubuntu users: 
=============================
1. Open terminal (Alt+Ctrl+T). 
2. Type the following commands: 
	sudo apt update 
	sudo apt install texlive-full 
	sudo apt install texstudio 

This method is applicable to any ubuntu based operating system (e.g., Linux Mint).
Thats it! Now you can open "TeXStudio" and start writing documents using LaTeX! 


Instructions for Windows users: 
===============================
"MikTeX" and "TeXLive" are two most popular LaTeX distributions for Windows useres! 

Process for installing MikTeX in Windows:
----------------------------------------- 
1. Go to "https://miktex.org/download" and click on "Download" button to download the Miktex installer. 

2. Double click on the downloaded file "basic-miktex-2.9.7351-x64.exe" to run the Miktex setup wizerd. 

3. Follow the screen instructions to complete the installation. 

4. Download a LaTeX editor, for example "TeXstudio" from "https://www.texstudio.org/", and install it 
by clicking on the installer file "texstudio-2.12.22-win-qt5.exe" and following the screen instructions. 

5. If you don't have any pdf file reader installed in your computer, download "Sumatra PDF" viewer 
from "https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/download-free-pdf-viewer.html". This is much lighter and faster 
than Adobe reader! 

Now you are ready to write basic LaTeX documents! 
The above mentioned "basic-miktex" installer installer do not install many packages, which we need often 
to write LaTeX documents. Therefore, we need to install full-miktex packages. 

How to install full-MikTeX? 
--------------------------- 
After done with the basic installations as instructed above, we need to download MikTeX-full packages! 
This step will take a log time and requires good internet connection. This will download approximately 4GB files. 
So make sure you are connected with a high speed wifi/LAN internet connection! 

1. Open start menu and look for "MikTeX Console". Right click on it, and open it as "Administrator". 

2. Click on the option "Packages" on the left. 

3. Click on the last column: "Installed on". This will rearrange the list according to "installed" packages. 

4. Scroll down the list to select the packages not yet installed. 
(Tips: Select the first package that is not installed yet >> scroll down to the bottom of the list >> 
Hold "Shift" key and select the last package. This will select all packages which are not yet installed.) 

5. Press the "+" sign (just above the file list) to start installing all the selected packages. 
This can take about two to three hours of time! 


If you do not prefer to use MikTex, here is an alternative software called "TeXLive".

Instruction to install TeXLive in Windows:
------------------------------------------
1. Go to "https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-iso.html". 
2. Select "download from a nearby CTAN mirror". 
3. Download "texlive2019.iso". 
4. Open the "texlive2019.iso" and run the file "install-tl-windows.bat". 
5. Follow the screen instructions to install texlive full version. 

Enjoy!
